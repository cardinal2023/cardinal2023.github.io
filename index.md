## Scope
Recently, the rapid development of Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) such as Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) (i.e., robots) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) (i.e., drones), has highlighted a myriad of new emergent applications such as infrastructure inspection and surveillance, smart agriculture, monitoring, search and rescue, parcel delivery, communications, and post-disaster recovery, just to mention a few.
In all these novel applications, ground and aerial vehicles may jointly work together, and also coexist with ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 
For instance, multiple UGVs can perform particular tasks relying on the IoT sensors' perceived data, while a swarm of UAVs can assist the UGVs relaying the collected data by the UGVs to the base station, in order to infer opportune decisions and take actions.
Therefore, efficient data collection and networking algorithms should be devised for.

For this workshop, we are looking for papers that combine the design of novel algorithms and testbed implementations to develop the theoretical foundations for UVs as well as the synergies with IoT devices. 
The numerous emergent applications raised by IoT may require an interdisciplinary approach, involving techniques from algorithm foundations and different areas, such as computer networks, artificial intelligence, concurrent, parallel and distributed computing, networking, security, digital signal, image and sound processing.
